:mod:`cli` --- command line tools
=================================

.. module:: cli
    :synopsis: Command line tools.

:mod:`cli` provides a suite of tools that simplify the process of
developing testable, robust and easy-to-use command line applications.
With :mod:`cli`, your scripts (and larger applications) can use Python's
extensive standard library to parse configuration files and command line
parameters, log messages and even daemonize. All of these services are
made available through the :class:`cli.app.Application` class, an instance of
which is passed to your script at run time. Even though it is
featureful, :mod:`cli` is decidedly unmagical.

Command line parsing::

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import cli

    @cli.CommandLineApp
    def ls(app):
        pass
    
    ls.add_param("-l", "--long", help="list in long format", default=False, action="store_true")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        ls.run()

.. highlight:: none

When run, this script produces the following output::

    $ python ls.py -h
    usage: ls [-h] [-l]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      -l, --long  list in long format

Logging::

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import time
    import cli
    @cli.LoggingApp
    def sleep(app):
        app.log.debug("About to sleep for %d seconds" % app.params.seconds)
        time.sleep(app.params.seconds)
    
    sleep.add_param("seconds", help="time to sleep", default=1, type=int)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        sleep.run()

.. highlight:: none

Which produces the following::

    $ python sleep.py -h
    usage: sleep [-h] [-l] [-q] [-s] [-v] seconds

    positional arguments:
      seconds        time to sleep

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help     show this help message and exit
      -l, --logfile  log to file (default: log to stdout)
      -q, --quiet    decrease the verbosity
      -s, --silent   only log warnings
      -v, --verbose  raise the verbosity
    $ python sleep.py -vv 3
    About to sleep for 3 seconds

Daemonizing::

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    import cli
    @cli.DaemonizingApp
    def daemon(app):
        if app.params.daemonize:
            app.log.info("About to daemonize")
            app.daemonize()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        daemon.run()

.. highlight:: none

And on the command line::

    $ python daemon.py -h
    usage: daemon [-h] [-l] [-q] [-s] [-v] [-d] [-u USER] [-p PIDFILE]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -l, --logfile         log to file (default: log to stdout)
      -q, --quiet           decrease the verbosity
      -s, --silent          only log warnings
      -v, --verbose         raise the verbosity
      -d, --daemonize       run the application in the background
      -u USER, --user USER  change to USER[:GROUP] after daemonizing
      -p PIDFILE, --pidfile PIDFILE
                            write PID to PIDFILE after daemonizing
    $ python daemon.py -d -vv
    About to daemonize

Basic usage
-----------

While the :mod:`cli` modules provide a simple API for designing your own
applications, the default implementations are intended to be flexible
enough to cover most use cases. No matter which :class:`cli.app.Application` you
use, the basic pattern is the same: create a callable that does the
work, wrap it in an :class:`cli.app.Application`, add some parameters and call
its :meth:`run` method.

Your callable may be a simple function or a more complex class that
implements the :meth:`__call__` protocol. Either way, it should accept a
single :data:`app` instance as its only argument. It will use this
object to interact with the application framework, find out what
arguments were passed on the command line, log messages, etc.

You can wrap the callable in one of two ways. First,
:class:`cli.app.Application` can be thought of as a decorator (see :pep:`318`
for more information). For example::

    @cli.Application
    def yourapp(app):
        do_stuff()

If you need to pass keyword arguments to the application, you can still
use the decorator pattern::

    @cli.CommandLineApp(argv=["-v"])
    def yourapp(app):
        do_stuff()

If you don't like decorators (or your interpreter doesn't support them),
you can also simply pass your application callable to the
:class:`cli.app.Application`::

    def yourapp(app):
        do_stuff()

    yourapp = cli.CommandLineApp(yourapp)

Most of the supplied :class:`cli.app.Application` implementations support
parameters. Parameters determine how your users interact with your
program on the command line. To add parameters to your application, call
:meth:`add_param` after you've wrapped your callable::

    yourapp.add_param("-v", "--verbose", help="increase the verbosity", default=0, action="count")

The interface here is the same as that implemented by
:class:`argparse.ArgumentParser`. In this case, an :attr:`verbose`
attribute will be created on the :attr:`app.params` object with an
integer representing the desired verbosity level.

Once you've added all the parameters you need (if any -- the default
implementations include sensible defaults), simply call the :meth:`run`
method on the wrapped callable. It's best to do this only if your script
is actually being run, so shield it with a conditional::

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        yourapp.run()

This will allow you to import your application and tweak it
programmatically from another script without actually invoking it.

Testing :class:`cli`
--------------------

cli ships with a number of unittests that help ensure that the code run
correctly. The tests live in the ``tests`` package and can be run by
``setup.py``::

    $ python setup.py test

You can get a sense for how completely the unittests exercise cli by
running the coverage_ tool::

    $ coverage run --branch setup.py test

``coverage`` tracks the code statements and branches that the test suite
touches and can generate a report listing the lines of code that are
missed::

    $ coverage report -m --omit "tests,/home/will/lib,lib/cli/ext,setup"

It's useful to omit the third party code directory (``ext``) as well as
the path to the Python standard library as well as ``setup.py`` and the
tests themselves.

All new code in cli should be accompanied by unittests. Eventually,
the unittests should be complemented by a set of functional tests
(especially to stress things like the daemon code).
