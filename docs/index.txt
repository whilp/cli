A note about versions
+++++++++++++++++++++

:mod:`cli` is developed along two branches. The first, 'default' (or 'master' in
git) contains new features and possible bugs -- this branch is the active
development branch. The second, 'stable', contains releases both major and minor
as well as bugfixes. If you'd like to help improve :mod:`cli`, take a look at
default/master. Otherwise, stick with stable.

Basic usage
-----------

While the :mod:`cli` modules provide a simple API for designing your own
applications, the default implementations are intended to be flexible
enough to cover most use cases. No matter which :class:`cli.app.Application` you
use, the basic pattern is the same: create a callable that does the
work, wrap it in an :class:`cli.app.Application`, add some parameters and call
its :meth:`run` method.

Your callable may be a simple function or a more complex class that
implements the :meth:`__call__` protocol. Either way, it should accept a
single :data:`app` instance as its only argument. It will use this
object to interact with the application framework, find out what
arguments were passed on the command line, log messages, etc.

You can wrap the callable in one of two ways. First,
:class:`cli.app.Application` can be thought of as a decorator (see :pep:`318`
for more information). For example::

    @cli.app.Application
    def yourapp(app):
        do_stuff()

If you need to pass keyword arguments to the application, you can still
use the decorator pattern::

    @cli.app.CommandLineApp(argv=["-v"])
    def yourapp(app):
        do_stuff()

If you don't like decorators (or your interpreter doesn't support them),
you can also simply pass your application callable to the
:class:`cli.app.Application`::

    def yourapp(app):
        do_stuff()

    yourapp = cli.app.CommandLineApp(yourapp)

Some more complex scripts and applications may benefit from subclassing the
:class:`cli.app.Application` class itself. This approach can help make your 
code more reusable::

    class YourApp(cli.app.CommandLineApp):
        
        def main(self):
            do_stuff()

When subclassing :class:`cli.app.Application`, you'll likely want to incorporate
functionality from the other application classes (like
:class:`cli.app.CommandLineApp`). To do this, simply call methods from the
appropriate mixin classes (like :class:`cli.app.CommandLineMixin`) -- in fact,
this is how the application classes themselves work.

Most of the supplied :class:`cli.app.Application` implementations support
parameters. Parameters determine how your users interact with your
program on the command line. To add parameters to your application, call
:meth:`add_param` after you've wrapped your callable (or in its :meth:`setup`
method)::

    yourapp.add_param("-v", "--verbose", default=0, action="count",
        help="increase the verbosity", )

The interface here is the same as that implemented by
:class:`argparse.ArgumentParser`. In this case, an :attr:`verbose`
attribute will be created on the :attr:`app.params` object with an
integer representing the desired verbosity level.

Once you've added all the parameters you need (if any -- the default
implementations include sensible defaults), simply call the :meth:`run`
method on the wrapped callable. It's best to do this only if your script
is actually being run, so shield it with a conditional::

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        yourapp.run()

This will allow you to import your application and tweak it
programmatically from another script without actually invoking it.

Best practices
--------------

:mod:`cli` is designed to encourage a simple set of best practices in
script development. Following this simple guide will help you write
robust, maintainable and user-friendly scripts.

Use a standard style
++++++++++++++++++++

A standard and clear coding style will make it easier for you to read
your scripts months or years after you first wrote them. A good style
will also help other people quickly understand your code so that they
can use it, too and (hopefully) help you improve it.

Since you're writing your scripts in Python, it is strongly recommended
that you follow the coding style described in :pep:`8`. This style is
easy to read and will be recognized by most people familiar with Python.

Modularize
++++++++++

Monolithic code is hard to read. By breaking your script into functions,
classes and maybe even separate modules, you help the reader (including
your future self) navigate the code. Modular code can also be easily
reused so that you don't have to continually reimplement useful
functions in all of your scripts.

When writing or refactoring your code to make it more modular, a good
rule of thumb is to break large functions or methods into chunks that
fit on a single screen (perhaps up to 50 lines of code or so). These
chunks are large enough to get the job done but small enough for your
reader to fully comprehend them.

Share your code
+++++++++++++++

If you've written modular code, you'll find it easy to package it for
wider distribution. Sharing your code helps other programmers or system
administrators solve similar problems. Even better, the more users you
have, the more likely you are to receive support or contributions from
your community.

Start with the `Hitchhiker's Guide to Packaging`_, which will soon become
part of the official `Python documentation`_.

.. _Hitchhiker's Guide to Packaging:    http://guide.python-distribute.org/
.. _Python documentation:       		http://www.python.org/doc/

Test your code
++++++++++++++

In most cases, you can make your code more robust by adding tests to
verify specific algorithms or even the macro behavior of the entire
script. For testing small chunks of your code (unit tests), :mod:`cli`
provides :class:`cli.test.AppTest`, a :class:`unittest.TestCase`
with a few customizations to make it more useful for testing
command line applications. To test larger behavior (functional
tests), use :class:`cli.test.FunctionalTest`. :mod:`cli` itself
uses both of these classes for its own tests; for examples, see the
:file:`tests/functional/` directory shipped with the :mod:`cli` package.

When packaging your scripts, use Titus' `SomePackage`_ as a guide for
integrating your tests.

Testing :mod:`cli`
------------------

:mod:`cli` ships with a number of unit tests that help ensure that the code runs
correctly. To run the tests, use the `tox`_ automated testing tool::
    
    $ tox

.. _tox:    http://codespeak.net/tox/

By default, :command:`tox` will attempt to run the unittests on all of the
platforms currently supported by :mod:`cli`. See the `tox documentation`_ for
more information about how to run tests.

.. _tox documentation:  http://codespeak.net/tox/index.html

You can get a sense for how completely the unit tests exercise :mod:`cli` by
running the unittests directly with `nose`_ and `coverage`_::

    $ nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=cli
    $ coverage report --omit "lib/cli/*ext*,lib/cli/tests/*"

.. _nose:        http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/
.. _coverage:    http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/

All new code in :mod:`cli` should be accompanied by unit tests. Eventually,
the unit tests should be complemented by a set of functional tests
(especially to stress things like the daemon code).
