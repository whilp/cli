Introduction

Installation
============

You can install cli from the `Python Package Index`_::
	
	$ easy_install pyCLI

If you'd like a recent development snapshot, you can fetch it from the
main `Mercurial`_ repository::
	
	$ wget http://code.lfod.us/cli/archive/tip.zip

Then run ``easy_intall` or ``python setup.py install`` as usual. If
you'd like to hack on cli, you can clone the entire repository and all of
its history::
	
	$ hg clone http://code.lfod.us/cli

Getting started
===============

Now that cli's installed, you can start using it in new scripts or
retrofitting old ones. Here are some examples; see the documentation for 
the :doc:`app` module for more information.

A simple case
+++++++++++++

In the simplest case, you might have a script that performs a series of
tasks. You haven't needed to define any functions, so it's rather
compact[#]_::

	#!/usr/bin/env python

	import shutil

	shutil.rmtree('/')

The :mod:`app` module provides a basic :class:`app.App` class that expects a
function (or other callable) as its first argument. To cli-ify this
simple script, we'll first need to wrap it in a function. Once wrapped
in a function, your code can be reused elsewhere, too. It's very common
to call this new function ``main``, but (as you'll see later) the App
class can work a little bit of magic if you give the function a more
informative name::

	#!/usr/bin/env python

	import shutil

	def remove_everything():
		shutil.rmtree('/')

Now, adding app functionality is easy::

	#!/usr/bin/env python

	import shutil

	def remove_everything(app):
		shutil.rmtree('/')

	if __name__ == "__main__":
		from cli import App
		app = App(remove_everything)
		app.run()

We import and instantiate the App object under the new conditional block
so that it only happens when Python executes the script directly -- you
can still import ``remove_everything`` without the importer having to 
bother with cli.App at all. We've also changed the signature of the
``remove_everything`` function so that it accepts an app instance as its 
only argument. This is how your script will interact with the app tools. 

.. [#]	And, of course, probably not a good idea.
